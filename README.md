# travian-graphic
Looking for volunteers to redesign all the graphics in TravianZ.
Currently, the graphics that used in clones are copy right material.
Who own the graphics will make you shut down your game server or even worst to sue you.
In order to prevent this issue, we need to replace all the graphics that are from the original game.
Anyone who is willing to desgin the graphics please leave a comment here.
Thank you.


The game script does not have legal issue.
